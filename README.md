# 100-days-of-JS
Repository to upload activities based on the 100 Days of JS course available on Udemy

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to practice JS daily (or as frequent as possible) and become fluent enough to try new frameworks of this languages in the future.

## Method
The method chosen is to attend an online course daily. The course chosen is 100 Days of JS, on udemy. I do not use JS on my daily basis, mainly because I am a data analyst and R and Python are my preferred languages for these kind of tasks.

I will try to commit a class activity per day.
